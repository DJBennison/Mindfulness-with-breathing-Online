            <h2>Information</h2>
            <h3>Here is some more information on how to practice!</h3>
            <p> 
                This app is not meant to replace the practice without any aid of a computer. You can do this by yourself when you remember. Get into seculsion, and devleop the skill of 
                being able to be joyfully satisfied without being dependent on anything. 
                The purpose of This site is to help encourage practicing cultivation of mind. For those just starting out I think this will be a helpful resource as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cultivate the skill of Sati (Mindfulness, To remember, to keep in mind, wakefulness) through staying engaged. By clicking on the bubble in the middle
                of the develop screen, or pressing space bar while hovering over the develop screen you change from inhale to exhale. The aim is to follow along with your own breath.
                When it's time to change, do so on the screen. This helps you to stay with focused on what is happening now. We are not aiming for a deep heavy state, rather cultivating a profound light one here and now.
                To be wide wake so we can see what's happening now, and change to the wholesome! This is what right noble mindfulness(Sati) is all about.
                
            </p>    
                
            <p>
                Wholesome thoughts help to gladden the mind. You can read the wholesome thoughts as a mantra to keep you in a good mood.
                One wholesome thought after another is the way to a wholesome state of mind. You can select new wholesome thoughts from the lists in the settings.
                You can also make your own list by typing in the field and pressing the Add Cutsom button. You can then switch to your custom list by
                clicking on it in the settings. Hovering over it you can see what's in your list. Double click to remove an item from your list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put in the right effort to change the hindrances. When you notice your mind wondering into the unwholesome click the spot button. 
                Recognize that the thought/feelings are not I/Me/Mine. Be glad that you can see it, if you can see it's not you. Now you can be glad and return to the breath, instead of being sad that the mind wandered.
                This is part of the training. Congratulations for catching it, you just made a wholesome change!
            </p>
            <p>
                Rain sounds have been added to help block out noise and help you get into seculsion, if folks around you are playing the television really loud.
                You can also be chill with whatever sounds are in your environment, in the heard is only the heard. The choice is yours! 
            </p>
